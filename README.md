# GPU-based CACGMM trainer in CuPy

This package adapts the complex angular GMM model and trainer from [pb_bss](https://github.com/fgnt/pb_bss) 
using [CuPy](https://github.com/cupy/cupy) for accelerated inference on the GPU.

At the moment, it is meant to be used with the [GSS](https://github.com/desh2608/gss) toolkit.
